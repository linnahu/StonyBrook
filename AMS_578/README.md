# AMS 578, Regression Theory

Learning Outcomes:<br>

1) Extend knowledge of probability theory.<br>
      * Central chi-square and central F-distributions.<br>
      * Bonferroni’s inequality applied to multiple tests of hypotheses.<br>
      * Scheffe’s multiple comparison procedures. <br>
      * Decomposing chi-square sums of squares.<br>
      * Expected value and variance of multiple linear combinations of random variables.<br>
<br>
2) Learn statistical procedures for the linear model.<br>
      * One predictor linear regression.<br>
      * Multiple predictor linear regression. <br>
      * Introduction to structural equation modeling issues, specifically mediation. <br>
      * Expected mean square computations and power calculations using the non-centrality parameter.<br>
      * Tests and confidence intervals for the one way and two way analysis of variance. <br>
      * Statistical procedures for multiple comparisons.<br>
<br>
3) Review scientific studies that use the techniques of the course.<br>
      * Read papers posted on class blackboard.<br>
      * Reference to papers for examples as techniques are studied in lecture.<br>
<br>
4) Learn the statistical computing package of the student’s choice and apply it to obtain the statistical model that generated a set of synthetic data. <br>
       * One predictor linear regression group project using synthetic data that requires students to merge separate files.<br>
      * Multiple predictor linear regression group project using synthetic data to recreate the statistical model that generated the data. Model includes non-linear predictors and interactions of up to three predictors.<br>
