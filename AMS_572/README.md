      * Maximum likelihood based methods;<br>
      * Confidence intervals;<br>
      * Hypothesis testing.<br>

3) Demonstrate skills for inference with one population mean (including derivation of the formulas using the pivotal quantity method):<br>
      * Inference on one population mean when the population is normal and the population variance is known;<br>
      * Inference on one population mean when the population is normal and the population variance is unknown;<br>
      * Inference on one population mean when the population distribution is unknown but the sample size is large;<br>
      * Normality test using the normal probability plot and the Shapiro-Wilk test.<br>

4) Demonstrate skills for inference with one population variance when the population is normal (including derivation of the formulas using the pivotal quantity method).<br>

5) Demonstrate skills for inference with two population means (including derivation of the formulas using the pivotal quantity method):<br>
      * Inference on two population means with paired samples – how to reduce that to inference on one population mean with the paired differences;<br>
      * Inference on two population means, two independent samples, when both populations are normal and the population variances are known;<br>
      * Inference on two population means, two independent samples, when both populations are normal and the population variances are unknown but equal;<br>
      * Inference on two population means, two independent samples, when at least one population distribution is not normal but both sample sizes are large.<br>

6) Demonstrate skills for inference with two population variances when both populations are normal (including derivation of the formulas using the pivotal quantity method) – especially the F-test for the equality of two population variances.<br>

7) Master the basic inference with proportions and count data (including derivation of the formulas using the pivotal quantity method for the inference on one-population proportion and two-population proportions):<br>
      * Inference on one population proportion – exact test and large sample inference;<br>
      * Inference on two population proportions, independent samples – exact test and large sample inference;<br>
      * Inference on two population proportions, paired samples – exact test;<br>
      * Inference with one-way contingency table, including the Chi-square goodness-of-fit test;<br>

9) Demonstrate skills with inference on several population means, independent samples – One-Way ANOVA:<br>
      * Understanding of the assumptions, derivation, interpretation of results from statistical analysis;<br>
      * Post-hoc (pairwise) comparison of the population means.<br>

10) Master the related SAS (and R, for classes beginning Fall 2014) procedures for all materials covered in lectures.<br>

11) Group presentations covering some of the materials in both text books not covered in the regular lectures including: <br>
