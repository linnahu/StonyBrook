# Design of Experiments

Learning Outcomes:<br>

1) Extend knowledge of probability theory.<br>
      * Central chi-square and central F-distributions.<br>
      * Non-central chi-square and non-central F-distributions.<br>
      * Multiple comparisons procedures including Bonferroni’s inequality, Scheffe’s multiple comparison procedures, and Tukey’s multiple comparison procedures. <br>
      * Decomposing chi-square sums of squares.<br>
      * Expected value and variance of sums of squares.<br>

2) Learn classical statistical designs.<br>
      * One-way layout.<br>
      * Randomized block designs.  <br>
      * Latin squares, Graeco-Latin squares, hyper Graeco-Latin squares including designs with replications. <br>
      * Two and three way layouts.<br>
      * designs.<br>
      * Random effect models.<br>
      * Mixed models.<br>

3) Power and sample size computations.<br>

4) Learn the statistical computing package of the student’s choice and apply it to obtain the statistical model that generated a set of synthetic data.<br>
