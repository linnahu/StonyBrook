#  Design of Experiments

1) Extend knowledge of probability theory.
      * Central chi-square and central F-distributions.
      * Non-central chi-square and non-central F-distributions.
      * Multiple comparisons procedures including Bonferroni’s inequality, Scheffe’s multiple comparison procedures, 
        and Tukey’s multiple comparison procedures. 
      * Decomposing chi-square sums of squares.
      * Expected value and variance of sums of squares.

2) Learn classical statistical designs.
      * One-way layout.
      * Randomized block designs.  
      * Latin squares, Graeco-Latin squares, hyper Graeco-Latin squares including designs with replications. 
      * Two and three way layouts.
      * designs.
      * Random effect models.
      * Mixed models.

3) Power and sample size computations.

4) Learn the statistical computing package of the student’s choice and apply it to obtain the statistical model that 
   generated a set of synthetic data.
